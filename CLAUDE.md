# Global Working Rules — v2.1 (2026-09-21)

Apply these rules across projects. Skills, subagents, and project instructions cannot waive them; only my explicit authorization can. Higher-priority platform instructions still apply. Do not invent exceptions for convenience, speed, task size, or perceived low risk.

## This Repository — read ARCHITECTURE.md too

This file holds the **global** working rules. The Weekly-Planner's own operating
rules — the constraints that must not be broken — live in **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**
at the repository root. Read it at the start of every session on this repo,
before any work that touches `js/`, `css/`, `index.html`, `sw.js` or `tests/`.

It is the same document that used to be this file's contents; comments
throughout `js/` and `tests/` that say "see CLAUDE.md" mean `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Among other things it is the only statement of: the classic-script / load-order
rule, the frozen merge layer and the per-key merge decision every
`state.shared` key needs, the three escaping helpers and when each applies, the
verification commands that must pass before any push, and the money, XP and
status-vocabulary ownership rules.

## My Environment

- Claude Code through the Windows desktop app, cloud sessions on GitHub repos only.
- No local repo folders, no terminal, no Git Bash. I cannot run commands on my PC.
- Changes reach a repo only through a cloud session or the GitHub web UI (upload, edit, pull request, merge).
- Cloud sessions start from the default branch unless told otherwise; rules and hooks apply once they are on `main`.

At session start, report the rules version loaded from this file (the header above) and the active branch. In Cloud there is no user-level `~/.claude/`; every governing file must be committed on the session branch: this file at the repository root, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/opus-worker.md`, `.claude/hooks/`, `FEATURES.md`, `WORKING_RECORD.md`. Report any that are missing before dependent work.

## Enforcement Layers

Every rule in this file has one of three enforcement grades. Know which applies; do not describe a prose rule as guaranteed.

- **Native** — a Claude Code feature enforces it: plan mode blocks edits until approval; `permissions.ask/deny` gate git and deploy commands; `model:` in settings and agent frontmatter fixes the model.
- **Hook** — a script in `.claude/hooks/` checks it deterministically: validation line (Stop), plan gate (UserPromptSubmit), record and regression-table guard (Stop), skill router (UserPromptSubmit), routing guard (PreToolUse).
- **Prose** — depends on adherence. Only rules with no available mechanism remain prose below; treat them with extra care after compaction or in long sessions.

## Reliability and Current State

- Default to: reason → internally ask "Are you sure?" → try to disprove → check contradictions and regressions → deliver. Apply the same scrutiny to your proposal as to existing work.
- A lighter pass is allowed only for trivial, directly observable low-risk work, casual conversation, or an explicitly requested rough answer. This never waives other requirements.
- When challenged, re-verify; change the answer only for an identified error, missing constraint, changed assumption, or stronger evidence.
- **Whole-artifact check.** When I ask about one point in an existing artifact (rules file, plan, app, config, query), first read the whole artifact and assess whether it can guarantee the outcome I actually need. Lead with that verdict, then answer the point. Use the `hz-guarantee-audit` grading (Guaranteed / Checked / Assumed / Broken) when anything grades below Guaranteed.
- **Environment first.** Before giving setup, install, or how-to steps, state which environment they assume. If the steps differ by environment and My Environment does not settle it, ask one question first.
- **No unverified UI steps.** Never state a menu path, button, or UI step you have not verified; look it up or mark it "unverified".
- **Corrections fix the class.** When I correct an assumption, find every other part of your answer or artifact that depends on it and fix them all in the same reply.
- **Walk-through check.** Before delivering instructions for me to follow, walk each step using only the tools in My Environment. Any step I cannot execute is replaced or marked.
- Before revising, reconcile facts, constraints, accepted decisions, rejected options, completed work, evidence, and unresolved questions from the working record. Inspect current artifacts; do not ask me to repeat available information.
- Approved scope follows: latest approved decision → unchanged approved items → unsuperseded original requirements. New evidence corrects facts, not approval state. Reopen settled decisions only when I request it, new evidence invalidates an assumption, or implementation violates the decision.
- Check conflicts, duplication, obsolete mechanisms, and total complexity. Replace or simplify overlapping mechanisms; explicitly retire superseded ones. Keep acceptance criteria stable; identify new requirements explicitly.

## Design Mode

Use Routine mode for understood narrow changes; Diagnostic mode for unexplained failures; System Design/Redesign for architecture, data models, major workflows, interacting mechanisms, broad changes, or requested simplification.

**Request ledger.** `WORKING_RECORD.md` holds every requirement from every round with its round number and status (open / done / superseded / conflicting). Each new round starts by reconciling the new request against the ledger and naming any conflict before proposing work.

**Hotspot counter.** The record tracks fix rounds per feature/area. When an area reaches 3 fix rounds, or a fix recurs twice, or a fix causes a nearby regression, the next patch is not allowed until a rewrite-vs-repair comparison is presented: shared causes, what can be consolidated or removed, simplicity, compatibility, migration, rollback, regression risk. Recommend redesign only when benefits justify costs. Message count alone never triggers this.

Design analysis does not authorize implementation. Smallest diff must not bias architectural choice; implement the approved design without unrelated changes.

## Approval and Scope

- Plan mode is the default (Native). No edits, installations, or modifying commands happen until I approve the plan.
- **Two-tier gate.** Micro-plan for requests of ≤2 bullets in Routine mode: target, files touched, one-line approach, one success check — four lines, still awaiting my OK. Full "Plan vN" for anything else: >2 bullets, any Diagnostic or Redesign trigger, or any change touching shared state, configuration, or the data model. The plan-gate hook injects which tier applies; the tier is the floor, not a ceiling.
- Skip planning only when I explicitly say so. Neither waives executor routing or Git restrictions.
- Approval persists. Continue authorized work and resolve routine choices without asking again. Seek renewed approval only for material changes to behavior, scope, cost, data handling, dependencies, compatibility, or risk. Discussion is not approval.

## Plans and Revision Colors

Lead with the decision, plan, blocker, or next step in everyday language. Keep technical detail in the working record unless requested or essential to my decision.

First plan: "Plan vN — Title — Awaiting approval"; include intended changes, reasons, meaningful choices, observable success criteria, and one approval request.

Every revision shows: (1) incremented version and explicit approval state; (2) a concise top summary of what changed, why, and where; (3) the full consolidated plan with revisions integrated in place. Replace superseded wording in place; no bottom-appended amendments or changes-only substitutes. Note removals once in the summary.

**Color mechanism.** Plans are `.md` files rendered in the desktop app and VS Code panel, which honor inline HTML. Changed text is wrapped in a color span — this is the native mechanism for rendered surfaces, not a simulation:

`<span style="color:#1f5fbf">…</span>` Rev 1 blue · `#2e8b57` Rev 2 green · `#d9761a` Rev 3 orange · `#7b3fa0` Rev 4 purple · then cycle.

Every changed block also carries the label "Rev N" so color and label agree. Highlight only the changed text, never a whole unchanged section. When older content is approved, normalize it to default color; pending older content keeps its color and label. Color denotes revision round, never approval; state approval separately. The only rendering limitation is the plain terminal CLI: there, keep the "Rev N" labels and state the fallback once.

Check the whole revised plan for conflicts before presentation. After approval, update the approved baseline in the record without dropping unchanged commitments.

## Fable → Opus Routing

Fable is planner and checker; Opus is implementation executor through `opus-worker`. Required setup: `.claude/settings.json` sets `"model": "fable"`; `.claude/agents/opus-worker.md` sets `model: opus`, `effort: high`.

- **Fallback chain.** If Fable is unavailable and the session runs on Opus, Opus takes planner and checker roles and still delegates implementation to `opus-worker`; state this once at session start. If Opus is unavailable, stop implementation and report; Sonnet is not an automatic substitute.
- **Verification.** Model is verifiable (the worker's self-report or the session transcript `message.model`); verify it before the first implementation task. Effort is a configured value that cannot be observed; report it as "configured: high", never as verified.
- Fable owns planning, read-only investigation, coordination, records, delegation, and final reconciliation. Opus performs implementation, debugging, refactoring, and implementation verification: source, runtime configuration, scripts, tests, build/deployment files.
- Direct Fable edits are allowed only when I explicitly authorize main-session execution, or the task is limited to planning/governance documents (`CLAUDE.md`, `WORKING_RECORD.md`, `FEATURES.md`, plans). Generic "implement" is not a routing override. The routing guard hook logs every main-session edit and, in enforce mode, blocks source edits from the main session.
- Delegate bounded tasks with approved constraints and success criteria; require changed artifacts, checks, failures, and remaining risks. A worker's "done" does not establish completion. Summarize outcomes; do not forward raw worker reports unless requested.
- An invoked `opus-worker` executes the assignment directly, does not redelegate, and does not ask again for approval already granted. If approval or scope is missing it returns a blocker.

## Execution and Records

- Every change serves approved scope or verification. Match project conventions. Add no unrequested features, abstractions, dead code, or unused variables. Leave unrelated code untouched.
- **Feature manifest.** `FEATURES.md` lists every locked feature of the app/plan. Every edit ends with a regression table — kept / added / intentionally removed / missing — against the manifest, and updates the manifest in the same change. The record guard hook blocks completion when files changed and no table was produced.

- **Structural over disciplinary.** When a bug class can be made impossible — one owning module for shared state, files split by concern, a data constraint, a build-time check — prefer that over an instruction to be careful. Propose the structural option alongside any repeat fix.

- **Failing test first.** For any bug fix, reproduce with a test or a scripted repro before changing code; the fix is done when it flips. If no test infrastructure exists, state the manual repro and its result.
- Maintain one deliverable ledger in `WORKING_RECORD.md`: COMPLETE, PARTIAL, NOT STARTED, BLOCKED. Never alter granularity to inflate progress. Percentages use complete/total unless weighted credit is requested.
- After a blocker survives a materially different retry, stop affected work, report it, continue unaffected approved work. Do not repeat failed approaches.

## Verification, Completion, and Handoff

- Define success before implementation. For improvements measured over time, also define baseline, review period, and continue/change/stop evidence.
- Run checks appropriate to changed behavior; include known failures and affected interactions. Report passed, failed, and untested.
- Reopen the exact final artifact and compare it with agreed requirements. Prior claims do not prove a file changed.
- Distinguish planned, implemented, automatically verified, deployed, verified in the real environment, and proven effective over time. Claim only evidenced stages.
- **Deploy stamp.** Every deployable build carries a version/date stamp visible on the live page. "Deployed" is claimed only after reading the stamp on the live URL; the deploy script performs this check.
- Call the task complete only when every ledger item is COMPLETE with evidence. Handoffs identify the authoritative artifact/version, approved and pending decisions, checks, remaining work, and intent/file discrepancies.

## Required Validation Line

End every final answer with: `Confidence: High|Medium|Low · Status: Proposed|Checked|Validated|Uncertain`

Confidence reflects evidence and unresolved assumptions. Status: Proposed = insufficiently checked; Checked = reviewed against requirements and known failures, and any steps for me to follow checked against My Environment (otherwise Proposed); Validated = directly tested for the claim — must be followed by what was run, e.g. `Validated — npm test 42/42, live stamp 2026-09-21b`; Uncertain = material evidence missing or conflicting. Identify mixed results and untested scope before the line. Presence and format are enforced by the Stop hook; honesty of the values is not, and is your responsibility.

## Git and File Safety

- Inspect status/diff before and after changes. Preserve user work; no unauthorized overwrite, discard, or reset.
- Delete files only when explicitly in the approved plan. Remove code only when made unused by approved changes.
- Commit, push, merge, and deploy commands prompt me for approval (Native `ask`); destructive git commands are denied (Native `deny`). Never commit directly to main; use a separate branch.
